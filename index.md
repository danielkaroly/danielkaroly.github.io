### Data Analytics Project: [Cocoa Belt of Africa](https://cocoabeltofafrica.streamlit.app/)
This project transitioned from exploratory data analysis in Jupyter notebooks to an interactive Streamlit application, focusing on cocoa production trends in key African countries. The Streamlit platform improved functionality, allowing for dynamic visualizations, real-time updates, and a more user-friendly interface for engaging with complex datasets.

### Data Science Project: [Natural Gas Futures Price Prediction](https://github.com/danielkaroly/Natural-Gas-Futures-Forecast)
In this project, I developed a model to predict future natural gas prices using both Monte Carlo simulation and time series prediction with Prophet. The data, sourced from a single online platform, was processed and analyzed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The Monte Carlo simulation provided probabilistic price forecasts, while the Prophet model leveraged historical data to generate accurate time series predictions.

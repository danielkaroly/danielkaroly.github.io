### Data Analytics Project: [Cocoa Belt of Africa](https://cocoabeltofafrica.streamlit.app/)
This project transitioned from exploratory data analysis in Jupyter notebooks to an interactive Streamlit application, focusing on cocoa production trends in key African countries. The Streamlit platform improved functionality, allowing for dynamic visualizations, real-time updates, and a more user-friendly interface for engaging with complex datasets.
